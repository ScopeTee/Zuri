            <h2>About Me<br />
                Your Next Software Engineer</h2>
        </header>
        <p> An enthusiastic Full-Stack Web Developer with elegant and innovative ideas coupled with the problem-solving skill to provide quick and long-lasting solutions to issues concerning the Web. <br> <br>
            I have been in the education industry for five years, working with a wide range of tools and technology at my disposal provided by the school. During this period, I realised I probably could write software and then took it upon myself to learn javascript. While in the education industry, I was also writing codes to improve myself. Afterwards, the pandemic hit, and as you know, the learning process was halted for some time, and the education industry was devastated. Hence, I leaned more into my engineering skillset, which has allowed me to work with several people on various projects.
            
            <br><br>As a focused, passionate, and professional individual who has transitioned into the Tech Industry, I dedicate time and resources to presenting existing and potential clients/employers with completed projects that meet and exceed their initial foresight. By employing my services, I am willing to be an asset to you and your organisation
